                    A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology
                    to continually provide value to customers. DevOps enables formerly siloed roles—development, IT operations,
                    quality engineering, and security—to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products.
                    By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond
                    to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals faster.

                    Cloud computing is taking the fore front in the race for technological advancement shaping the world in its
                    reality with tech giants moving into this space as well as start ups. However the opportunity to integrate
                    and use various cloud technologies is rested on the services provided by various cloud platforms like Amazon
                    Web Service, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. These platforms are riddled with various degrees of
                    complexities in its setup and integration, take AWS (Amazon Web Service) for example, it provides a three
                    tier application service which starts with the creation of an instance and subsequently the creation of a
                    network gateway, multiple security groups, an RDS section and other dependencies all needing an expert to be
                    integrated and hosted on the AWS cloud platform. To integrate or use cloud services is not an easy operation
                    and would often time require an expert, in this sense a DevOps engineer. Consulting with DevOps experts like
                    Devtegrate is the best response to integrate, automate and use of cloud service tools. Once you contact us,
                    we will begin consulting with you on the best ways to incorporate DevOps into your business operations.
